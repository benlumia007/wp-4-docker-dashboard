title: About Me

Hello, thanks for visiting. I’m Benjamin Lu, a computer technician by day and a freelance web designer by night. I have been hooked on web developing since 2000 and started teaching myself the basic of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, and PHP

I graduated from ITT Technical Institute and received an Associates Degree in Computers and Electronics Engineering Technology and a Bachelors Degree  in Electronics and Communication Engineering Technology. During the time at ITT Technical Institute, started working as a Help Desk Engineer with Accent Computer Solutions and Tech Rockstars former known as (Price Enterprise), helping customers/clients with every day computer solutions.

After attending at ITT Technical, I started experimenting with WordPress.com at first and realized that WordPress.org can be used to create and modify websites for free. During that time experimenting with WordPress, I have learned as much as possible about PHP, CSS, HTML and JavaScript and am able to create a website or blog with these tools.

I have recently submitted two WordPress themes in the Theme Directory, “Silver Platinum” based on “Twenty Twelve” and Silver Quantum. I am currently working on a new theme, “White Premium”.

Please come back soon for new stuff.

Thanks for stopping by!
